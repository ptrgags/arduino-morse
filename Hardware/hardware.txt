Hardware:

Components Needed:
- Arduino Uno
- MCP23017 16-port IO Expander
- 16 LEDs (I used two bar graphs)
- 16 Resistors (I used 10k Ohm, but 1k could work too)

Arduino Connections:
SDA -> SDA (PIN 13) on MCP23017
SCL -> SCL (PIN 12) on MCP23017
5V  -> VDD (PIN 9) on MCP32017
GND -> VSS (Pin 10) on MCP23017
Pin 3 -> Piezo Buzzer -> GND

MCP23017 Connections:
Pins 1-8 (IOB)     -> Each connected to 1 LED -> Resistor -> GND
Pin 9 (VDD)        -> 5V on Arduino
Pin 10 (VSS)       -> GND on Arduino
Pin 11 (NC)        -> Not connected
Pin 12 (SCL)       -> SCL on Arduino
Pin 13 (SDA)       -> SDA on Arduino
Pin 14 (NC)        -> Not connected
Pins 15-17 (A0-A2) -> GND for address (0x20)
PIN 18 (RESET)     -> 5V to disable reset
Pins 19-20 (INTs)  -> Not connected
Pins 21-28 (IOA)   -> Each connected to 1 LED -> Resistor -> GND


Additional Notes:
- The LEDs on port A are used for sending signals; they all turn
    on or off at the same time
- The LEDs on port B are used for displaying the last 8 bits in the 
    morse message
